# Data-Driven Reloading

## Stop chasing ghosts. Learn to test handloads the way that actually reveals truth.

### The Problem

You've spent hundreds of dollars and dozens of hours developing the "perfect" load. Your 5-shot group measured 0.6 MOA. Your chronograph showed 8 fps SD. You posted the results online with pride.

Then you went back to the range. Same rifle, same ammo, same conditions.

Groups opened up to 1.2 MOA. SD jumped to 17 fps. Your "perfect" load disappeared like it never existed.

**What happened?**

You fell victim to the biggest lie in reloading testing: **Small samples tell the truth.**

They don't. They lie. Consistently. Predictably. And they've been lying to handloaders for decades.

### The Solution

This curriculum teaches you evidence-based ammunition testing methodology. You'll learn:

- **Why small samples mislead** (and how much ammunition you really need)
- **What consistency actually means** (it's not what you think)
- **How to design proper experiments** (one variable at a time)
- **When differences are real** vs. random variation
- **Which testing methods work** (and which are statistical noise)

By the end, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Design experiments that actually reveal the truth
- ✅ Calculate appropriate sample sizes for your questions
- ✅ Interpret data correctly without fooling yourself
- ✅ Spot red flags in online claims instantly
- ✅ Save hundreds of dollars by avoiding false leads

### Who This Is For

**This course is for you if:**
- You're tired of "perfect" loads that don't repeat
- You want to understand WHY things work, not just copy recipes
- You're willing to invest in proper testing to save money long-term
- You "hated math in school" but want to learn anyway (everything is explained in plain English)

**This course is NOT for you if:**
- You want load recipes (we teach methodology, not specific loads)
- You're looking for shortcuts (proper testing uses more ammunition upfront, but saves far more in wasted components)
- You're convinced your current methods are perfect

### About This Curriculum

**Free. Open-source. Evidence-based.**

This curriculum applies fundamental statistical principles to ammunition testing. The methods taught here are the same used in scientific research, manufacturing quality control, and clinical trials.

You're not learning "reloading statistics." You're learning **real statistics** applied to a practical problem you care about.
